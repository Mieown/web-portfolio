        <p className="About-textinfo">Iâ€™m a hard working and dedicated professional front-end developer/user interface designer with a keen eye for detail, and a determination to deliver the very highest quality. I take great pride in my work, and I always try to better myself with every project I work on. I like to write semantic, cross browser compatible code by hand that is re-useable, maintainable and easy to understand. I am motivated, enthusiastic and well organised, with a keen eye for beautiful design, primarily based around user interfaces. The main areas of my expertise are HTML(5), CSS(3) and JavaScript (native and jQuery) but I have intermediate knowledge of PHP and MySQL. I have worked with a number of high profile clients (both directly and indirectly) and I am comfortable working under pressure to complex specifications. I regularly use version control systems (GIT, Mercurial) to maintain my code, and I specialise in responsive web design (RWD). My preferred CMS is WordPress, and I am comfortable building bespoke themes from the ground up. I have also written a couple of relatively simple jQuery plugins</p>
